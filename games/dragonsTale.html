        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You're a dragon reappearing in the woods, they seem a little different each time</p>
        <p>Evolve to find and stop the cause</p>
        
        <h2>What I've learned</h2>

        <p>Animator State machines</p>
        <p>Delegates and Events</p>

        <p>Particle System</p>
        <p>Improved animating</p>


        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>A passion project made during the Covid pandemic</p>
        <p>It's a remaster of a game I made in 2018</p>

        <p>There were supposed to be more levels and the bigger dragons were meant for harder enemies</p>
        <p>But as I leared the hard way, the scope was WAY too ambitious</p>
        <p>I learned that animating each enemy frame-by-frame is a huge time commitment</p>

        <p>I put a lot of effort into this so I wanted to wrap it up into a game</p>
        <p>the goal was to learn new Unity features</p>

        <h2>Bonus</h2>
        <p>After wrapping the game up I felt like redesigning the dragon again and making concepts for the enemies I had in mind</p>
