        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a multiplayer strategy game... i guess. There are 3 knight factions:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../img/games/knights18.png" alt="tank">
            <img src="../img/games/knights19.png" alt="sword">
            <img src="../img/games/knights20.png" alt="thorn">
        </div>
        <p>Each faction has it's unique passive marked with:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../img/games/knights12.png" alt="passive">
            <img src="../img/games/knights15.png" alt="passive">
        </div>
        <p>Each round, the player has a chance to upgrade his health, damage or passive</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../img/games/knights9.png" alt="healt">
            <img src="../img/games/knights11.png" alt="passive">
            <img src="../img/games/knights12.png" alt="passive">
        </div>
        <p>First player that has 0 lives loses...obviously</p>
        <h2>What I've learned</h2>
        <p>This was my first online game. The left and right client communicate through ports</p>
        <p>I wouldn't call it a "perfect" or even a "good" system but I basically send the info through chat</p>
        <p>I learned about some quircks and tricks of JavaFX which is normally used for form filling.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p> I had 3 weeks to think of and make a multiplayer game in a program </p>
        <p>that has more similarities to css than to a game engine</p>
        <p> I am quite pleased with the result</p>
