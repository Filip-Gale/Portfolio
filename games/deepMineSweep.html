        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try and get the high score by evading and shooting mines:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../img/games/mine.png" alt="mine">
        </div>
        <p>Hitting a mine makes the player lose</p>
        <h2>What I've learned</h2>
        <p>This is my first mobile project</p>
        <p>I learned a lot about Android Studio and the difference between PC and mobile apps</p>


        <div class="image-container" id="sub">
            <img src="../img/games/sub.png" alt="sub">
            </div>

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I followed a tutorial on how to make the game but I like to think I made several improvements to the controls</p>
        <p>Android Studio seems like a buggy mess to deal with and every tutorial older than 6 months is deprecated</p>
        <p>It's not meant for making games so of course it was hard. And yet, achieveable</p>
        <p> I am pleased with the result</p>
